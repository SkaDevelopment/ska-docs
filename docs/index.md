## 🔐 Encryption

All SKA resources are partially encrypted using the official FiveM Asset Escrow system.

This means that some parts of the code are not fully accessible. Don’t worry only the necessary parts are protected.

This protection exists to:

- Prevent leaks and unauthorized redistribution
- Protect both the buyer and the developer
- Ensure long-term support and fair usage

Even highly trusted organizations can be affected by data breaches. The escrow system provided by Cfx.re is currently the safest and most reliable solution for resource protection.

You should not feel limited by this encryption:

- Extensive configuration options are always provided
- As much unencrypted code as possible is included
- HTML / UI files are never encrypted, allowing full design customization

If you believe you need access to a specific encrypted part:

- Contact me on Discord
- Clearly explain what you need and why
- If feasible, the requested access may be added in a future update
